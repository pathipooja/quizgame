# quizgame
My first project in C.
I've build this project along with my friend Yasa Sindhu using C language.
We implemented this project using the files concept and structures.
Since a quiz includes questions along with multiple choices,we thought it would be better to choose structures for storing the questions that are retrieved from a file.
The thing we felt good about,at the end of coding the current version of our project,is that "We used a single file for storing different level of questions like easy,medium and hard".
Since we included 4 different types of quiz,till now we used 4 files for the purpose of storing questions.
Rest of the files are included for UI.

We divided the features we want to implement into 3 categories
1.Must have
2.Good to have
3.Optional
As of now,we are done with the must have features and some of the good to have features.
Currently we are working on the remaining features as well.
